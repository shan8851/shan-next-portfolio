I've been pondering what tech stack to focus on next. Don't get me wrong, I love working with React and Typescript, but I feel like it is time to broaden my skillset a little. So, I've decided to dive back into something that's always caught my interest: **Solidity and blockchain development**. I'm currently working in the crypto space, am very bullish on the technology, so it seems like a perfect fit to complement my Javascript skills.

## Why Am I Going Back to Solidity?

Blockchain technology has always intrigued me. There's something about its promise for a more secure and transparent digital world that I find compelling. Plus, the technical challenges it presents are the kind you really want to get stuck into.

> Picking a niche isn't just about job prospects; it's about choosing something that keeps you glued to the screen.

## What Have I Done Before?

I've dabbled in Solidity in the past. Completed a few tutorials, even wrote a faucet contract foe developers to request and donate test eth. It was good fun, but for one reason or another I lost focus and spent time enhancing my frontend skills for current work responsibilities . Now, I'm keen to get back to it and go a bit deeper.

## The Plan of Action

I'm hitting the ground running. I'm starting fresh with [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/), an interactive course that teaches Solidity through coding your own zombie game. I have been through the beginner to intermediate course once before, but I think a refresher is a smart starting point. Alongside that, I'm diving into core blockchain concepts.

- Investigating different smart contract applications
- Hands-on work with tools like Truffle and Web3.js
- Building a few small to medium-sized dApps

## What’s Next?

I’ll be sharing my progress as I go along. Expect updates, new findings, and hopefully, some useful resources. If you're on a similar journey or are thinking about diving in, give me a shout.

That's it for now. If the world of smart contracts and dApps excites you as much as it does me, keep an eye out. We're just getting started.
