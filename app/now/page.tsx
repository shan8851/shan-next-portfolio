        <h3>Work & Learning</h3>
        <p>Career growth. In me early years I was obsessed with growth and becoming a better engineer, but over the years I have got a little comfortable and complacent. However, the itch is back, I really want to delve back in, work hard and see where I can go!</p>

          <a>TechLeap</a>: Blurring the lines between work and play, I recently launched TechLeap, a weekly newsletter for aspiring devs. We&apos;re all about landing that first job, maximizing earnings, and levelling up in the early years of the dev journey.

          UPDATE (Aug 23). Tech Leap is pretty much done with. I had slow initial growth paired with missing a few issues due to life getting in the way. It&apos;s a shame, I still really want to write regularly, but the short shelf life here kinda tells me I got the topic wrong. Watch this space. Having said that if I get a sudden rush of subscribers I may well be back. In the meantime I am continuing to write via my blog here.
