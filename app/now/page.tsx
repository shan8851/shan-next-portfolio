        <h2>Work & Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Career growth. In me early years I was obsessed with growth and
          becoming a better engineer, but over the years I have got a little
          comfortable and complacent. However, the itch is back, I really want
          to delve back in, work hard and see where I can go!
        </p>

          <a href="https://cielo.finance/">Cielo</a>: Still working hard in the
          Cielo Finance project, we have shipped some big things lately and
          there is more to come. I&apos;m naturally very bullish on the project,
          the team and crypto in general. I&apos;m excited to see where we can
          take this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cielo used python for the backend, I really want to start working more
          accross the full stack again, so to do that here I need to get up to
          speed with Python. I&apos;ve made a start, it&apos;s slow going so
          far, but hopefully I can push on in the coming weeks

        <h2>Balance</h2>
        <p>
          I am trying to find a better balance between work and life, I have a
          tendency to get obsessed with work and let it take over my life. I am
          trying to be more mindful of this and make sure I am spending time
          with my family and friends, and also taking time to relax and
          recharge. I started playing 7-a-side football again, which is a great
          way to get some exercise and socialise. Alongside this I am still
          working hard with the thai boxing, fitness and technique are
          improving, but I still have a long way to go.
