          Career growth. In me early years I was obsessed with growth and
          becoming a better engineer, but over the years I have got a little
          comfortable and complacent. However, the itch is back, I really want

          <a href="https://app.cielo.finance/">Cielo</a>: Still working hard in the
          Cielo Finance project, we have shipped some big things lately and
          there is more to come. I&apos;m naturally very bullish on the project,
          the team and crypto in general. I&apos;m excited to see where we can
          take this.
